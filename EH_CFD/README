To run this case

step 0: do git submodule init 
and git submodule update to get the 
current Nek5000 code

step 1: load intel compilers
module use /nopt/modulefiles/
module load compilers/intel/18.0.3.222
module load mpi/intelmpi/18.0.3.222

step 2: the file enzdata contains
relevant parameters.
set them accordingly or use the default.

step 2: use the run.sh script. it needs
number of MPI ranks as arguments. It needs 
atleast 32 ranks to run, otherwise the problem will be
too large for each task. The run.sh has a build section.
This may ask if you need to build thirdparty when being done for first time.
say yes.
e.g. . ./run.sh 96

I have also set the max number of steps to 10.
Ideally you want to set the final time to ~ 1000 seconds and
set the iterations to 0.

step 3: if you want to see mesh and solutions, open the 
paddle.nek5000 file. modify the numtimesteps in it.

TODO: 
1) run longer case - will take ~ 6 days
2) modify the fort.42 file to print glucose conc also along with conversion
