To run this case

STEP 0: do 'git submodule init' 
and 'git submodule update' to get the 
current Nek5000 code

STEP 1: Build additional Nek5000 tools
cd to the /submodules/Nek5000/tools/ directory

load an appropriate compiler with:
module purge
module use /nopt/nrel/apps/modules/centos77/modulefiles/
module load intel-mpi/2020.1.217

build the additional Nek5000 tools with:
./maketools all

STEP 2: Simulation setup
cd back to the /EH_CFD/ directory

load intel compilers with:
module purge
module use /nopt/modulefiles/
module load compilers/intel/18.0.3.222
module load mpi/intelmpi/18.0.3.222

STEP 3: Locate the file enzdata which contains
relevant parameters.
set them accordingly or use the default.

STEP 4: use the run.sh script. it needs
number of MPI ranks as arguments. It needs 
atleast 32 ranks to run, otherwise the problem will be
too large for each task. The run.sh has a build section.
This may ask if you need to build thirdparty when being done for first time.
say yes.
for example: ./run.sh 96

I have also set the max number of steps to 10.
Ideally you want to set the final time to ~ 1000 seconds and
set the iterations to 0.

STEP 5: if you want to see mesh and solutions, open the 
paddle.nek5000 file. modify the numtimesteps in it.

TODO: 
1) run longer case - will take ~ 6 days
2) modify the fort.42 file to print glucose conc also along with conversion
