====================================================
To compile
====================================================
You will need gfortran and f2py

Go to bld folder

to make fortran executable:
$make

to make f2py version - you need f2py
$make ptpython
====================================================
To run
====================================================
Go to test folder

copy the executable "pretreat.exe" and shared library "libptreat.so"
to the folder. 
Pretreat_Defs.inp contains mesh/initial/boundary/kinetics parameters

to run the fortran exectuable
$./pretreat.exe

to run python version
copy the shared library after f2py build to test folder
$python ptrun.py
====================================================
To post-process
====================================================
run bash-script postproc.sh in test. It uses the output files
to generate a time history plot

One will need the FIS at the end of the run to translate to the 
enzymatic hydrolysis
====================================================
Things to do
====================================================
1) cleaner build with cmake
2) set rpath in build and avoid copying the shared library, did nt work on mac
due clang and the need to use dylib
3) postprocessing recalcitrant to facile cellulose ratio after pretreatment
4) may be rewrite the PDE solver with Fenics
====================================================
