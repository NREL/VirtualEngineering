Welcome to Virtual Engineering's documentation!
===============================================

The Virtual Engineering (VE) project provides a set of Python modules to enable users to connect mathematical models of unit operations to predict outcomes for an entire chemical process.  This VE approach is currently being developed to support the beginning-to-end simulation of the low-temperature conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to a fuel precursor.

Organization
------------

Documentation is currently organized into three main categories:

* :ref:`How to Guides`: User guides covering basic topics and use cases for the VE software
* :ref:`Technical Reference`: Programming details on the VE API and functions
* :ref:`Background`: Information and research sources for the low-temperature conversion unit operations

New users may find it helpful to review the :ref:`Getting Started` materials first.
