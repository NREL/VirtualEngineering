Welcome to Virtual Engineering's documentation!
===============================================

The Virtual Engineering (VE) project provides a set of Python modules to enable users to connect mathematical models of unit operations to predict outcomes for an entire chemical process.  This VE approach is currently being developed to support the beginning-to-end simulation of the low-temperature conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to a fuel precursor.

--------------------------

Documentation is currently organized into two main categories, "How to Guides" which guide a user through some of the initial set up and simulation procedures and "Technical Reference" which documents the API and background of the VE functions.
